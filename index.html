				<p class="profiili" id="profiili">
					I am an information systems science student at University of Jyväskylä with multiple years of work experience with software development and IT products. My current interests are quite wide around IT, and I have switched from my previous development career focus into working closer to customers and managing IT products. I’ve found my career goal to be working with large public IT procurements and ultimately being able to create complex IT procurement requirements to ensure well working products for the public sector. To reach that goal I’m looking for roles such as product owner, business analyst, public IT management/procurements, service designer, or similar tasks to gain valuable expertise. 			    </p>


			    <div class="laatikko" id="työkokemus">

			    	<h3>Work experience</h3>
					<h4>Airbus Defence and Space – Product Business Management Trainee</h4>
 					<h4>May 2023 – December 2024</h4>
					<p>
						As a trainee in the Product Business Management team, I assisted in day-to-day tasks such as implementing a study to gather information for feature prioritization, helping answer bid requirements, handling Jira Structure queries and working with product documentation. I’ve gained valuable experience wokring with an international team as the working language for the group has been English.
					</p>


					<h4>Rare - Frontend Developer and Designer </h4>
                    <h4>June 2020 – April 2023</h4>
                    <p>At Rare I worked with multiple clients in a variety of web projects as a frontend developer and additionally participated in ux/ui design.
						My work included direct communication with clients in both Finnish and English. Working in a small company allowed me to have wide role in both development and design as well as taking responsibilities at the organizational level of the company.
						Public references that I have been working with are <a href="https://linnunrata.fi/fi/" class="linkki" target="_blank">linnunrata.fi</a> and <a href="https://instagrid.co" class="linkki" target="_blank">instagrid.co</a>.
					</p>


			    	<h4>Contact center Moment Group</h4>
			    	<h4>July 2018 - August 2019</h4>
			    	<p>I took care of several companies' customer services and switches. 
						Successful customer encounters required finding relevant information fast and using multiple different softwares e.g. for time reservation. I used three different languages: Finnish, Swedish and English

					<h3>Education</h3>

			    	<h4>University of Jyväskylä</h4>
			    	<h4>Information systems science, 2021 – Present</h4>

					<p>In addition to information systems studies such as digital service design, IT project management, and strategic IT management, I have minored in economics and am finishing a minor in commercial law. My <a href="http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:jyu-202501241525" class="linkki" target="_blank">bachelor’s thesis</a> is about innovative information system procurements in the public sector and I’m in the planning phase of my master's thesis.</p>
			    	
					<h4>Tampere University</h4>
			    	<h4>Computer science, 2017 – 2021 </h4>

                    <p>I studied computer science for four years and switched to information systems before finishing my bachelor’s degree.  I applied to computer science with no previous experience of programming, but I quickly found my interest towards frontend web development and design. Later in my studies I took classes on knowledge management which pushed me towards my current studies. </p>					
					<h4>University of Alaska Fairbanks</h4>
					<h4>Spring 2019</h4>

					<p>I spent spring 2019 at Alaska as an exchange student. In addition to computer science studies, I took public speaking and a practical class focused on practicalities of videography. Studying abroad was a great way to improve my English reading and communication skills.</p>

					<h3>Positions of trust</h3>

					<p>Taking responsibilities and achieving positions of trust within organizations have always been close to my heart and I would name that as my dearest hobby. Already during my first school year as seven-year-old child I established my own penguin club (which actually had activities such snow castle building and playing super penguins) which many of my neighborhood’s children joined. Later I have participated in the activities of many more real organizations which most recent of you can find more information from below. 
					</p>
					
					<br/>

					<h4>Tietotekniikan Opiskelijoiden Liitto ry (TiTOL)</h4>
					<h4>Member of board, Vice Chair, Chair</h4>
                    <h4>2020, 2023-2024</h4>
						<p>
							TiTOL is the union of computer science students and other closely related study fields. I was a board member for the first time in 2020. That year we created the first three-year strategy for TiTOL. In 2022 I felt that significant progress had not been made within the organization and decided to run for board again. As a board we made new more clear strategy that is easier to implement. 2024 I continued in the board as chair to facilitate strategy implementation and continue to push TiTOL to be more visible for our member organizations.
							<br/><br/>
							In addition to my duties as a chair I was a main organizer of ATK-YTP Jyväskylä in 2024. ATK-YTP is yearly two-day event that gathered this time 500 IT-students from 7 university cities together.
						</p>

					<br/>

                    <h4>Student Union of the University of Jyväskylä (JYY)</h4>
					<h4>Member of council or representatives, Debuty member of council of representatives</h4>
                    <h4>2022-present</h4>
					<p>
						From 2022 through 2023 I was a member of JYY’s council of representatives and last fall I was elected to continue in the council as a deputy member.
						<br/><br/>
						In 2023 I was elected Vice Chair of the council. In this position I was more involved in student union activities. Additionally, I was in charge of the selection committee which made selection proposals of new student representatives in university administration. The selection committee was an interesting opportunity to learn to interview candidates and how to lead processes where individuals and their suitability to different positions are discussed. Overall, being a council member has been a valuable experience to develop collaboration skills with other groups that many times have different opinions on how JYY should operate.
						<br/><br/>
						In addition to actual council work I have designed and developed the new website for our council group PD.
						</p>

                    <h4>Luuppi ry</h4>
					<h4>Member of board and multitude of other responsibilities</h4>
                    <h4>2018-2022</h4>
              		<p>
						Luuppi ry is the student organization of computer science, mathematics, and statistics students at Tampere university. I have been part of the board two times. I started right away as a freshman in the corporate relations team and was chosen to be responsible for corporate relations to Luuppi’s 50th anniversary celebrations. I continued in corporate relations for another year and after that I was the responsible of social affairs, educational policy of computer science, and equality. The following year I was part of the facilities team for the new rental venue Pii-Klubi since I designed and implemented the website for the venue. After moving my studies to Jyväskylä I still managed to find myself organizing the yearly event of mathematics and physics students that Luuppi was part of organizing. Once again I was implementing the website and in addition I designed the graphics for the event.
						<br/><br/>
						This spring on Luuppi’s 55th anniversaty celebrations I was awarded with a silver badge of honor for my work within the organization.

                    <h4> Student Union of the Tampere University (TREY)</h4>
					<h4>Debuty member of council of representatives</h4>
                    <h4>2019 – 2021</h4>
					<p>
						I was a deputy member of the council of representatives at TREY. Our council group had only one-to-two council spots which made collaboration with other groups crucial. In addition to actual council work, I designed and developed the new website for our council group Luuppi_Puolue.					</p>
